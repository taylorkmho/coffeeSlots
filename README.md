# coffeeSlots
This project was produced for [Thumbtack's Espresso Bar Slot Machine](https://www.thumbtack.com/challenges/slot-machine) coding challege.


## Getting it up and running
This project utilizes NodeJS and Bower to manage its dependencies and scripts. Run `npm install && bower install` to bring in its dependencies. Then run `npm start` to get the server running. If a window does not automatically open, head over to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).


#### Still getting errors?
You may need to install NodeJS. One way is to head over to their [homepage](https://nodejs.org/en/) and install it from there.
